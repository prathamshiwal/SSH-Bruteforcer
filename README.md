# SSH-Bruteforcer

This is basic SSH bruteforcing tool. There are two scripts which are different in terms of there working speed. the script sshbruteforcer-slow.py works slow and sshbruteforcer.py works fater because it uses threading to attempt passwords on the SSH service.
These Scripts require a Taget IP on which the SSH service is running and also needs the name of the user for that particular IP Address.
A Password file (e.g. basicpassfile.txt, longpassfile.txt) is also needed to bruteforce the SSH service with different passwords.
